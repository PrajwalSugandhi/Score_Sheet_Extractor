## üí° How It Works

1. The app provides two options: create a new Excel file or upload an existing one.
2. Users capture an image of a student's answer sheet using the app.
3. The image is captured using the Flutter `cunning_document_scanner` camera, which processes and sends only the document image to the backend.
4. The app detects the table containing marks and the student's roll number and extracts the data.
5. The roll number's location on the sheet is identified using template matching in the backend.
6. For creating a new Excel file, student names are retrieved from the database. For uploading an existing Excel file, the names are taken from the uploaded file.
7. Multiple entries can be added to a single Excel file.
8. The data is exported to an Excel sheet using the Flutter `excel` package and saved on the user's mobile device.
9. Admins can manage student records through a dedicated admin panel.
